        The idea behind TIMIT started out of my own experience with keeping
        track of time for the projects I was building or assisting in for a
        client. Most clients want to see an overview of what I did and how long
        I worked on a specific feature. So mostly I wrote it down on some paper
        or inside my note app. Keeping track of all my projects became a bit
        messy. So that inspired me to start TIMIT.

        This experience has changed the way I look at web apps. It induced more
        respect for what other developers are creating. The process of finding a
        problem and building a solution for it looks simple, but was more
        complex than I thought. I first started to build the functionality in
        Veu.js, and when everything was working I attached the backend and
        database to it and finished it off by adding user authentication and
        Oauth ID.

        Being able to create a simple full stack app like this, after 6 months
        of hard work and dedication to learning coding from scratch, feels
        really good!
